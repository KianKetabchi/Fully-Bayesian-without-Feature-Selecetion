# Fully Bayesian Learning of Libby-Novick Beta Mixture Models Applied to Medical Application

In this study, we first introduced a new mixture model based
on Libby-Novick Beta distribution with three parameters.
We used full Bayesian framework to estimate our modelâ€™s
parameters based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique.
We used a hybrid sampling-based M-H-within-Gibbs learning
algorithm. Finally, we applied our model on two real-world
application (Breast tissue analysis)
and evaluated our model performance by comparing it with
Guassian Mixture Model. From the results, we can conclude
that the Libby-Novick mixture Model has a better performance
in comparison with the performance of Gaussian mixture
Model.
