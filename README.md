Breast tissue analysis
Cancer death is one of humanityâ€™s main challenges in
the developing countries. Even though there are many ways
to prevent cancer from occurring in the first place, some
cancer types remain untreatable. Breast cancer is the
most frequent cancer in women, and the most common type
of breast cancer is invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC).
Automated approaches can be utilised to save time and reduce
error for detecting and categorising breast cancer subtypes,
which is a crucial clinical activity. In this study, we used
Breast Histopathology Images (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images). 
This dataset consists of 162
whole mount slide images of Breast Cancer specimens. From
that, 277,524 patches of size 50 x 50 were extracted (198,738
IDC negative and 78,786 IDC positive).
